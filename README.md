## Introduction

Hey! Welcome to Reload. If you're viewing this page, you've decided to throw your hat into the ring with us, and we're delighted! Below we have provided some instruction on a 'test project' we'd like for you to undertake, as well as how to return it to us. We're not gonna beat around the bush, the test is designed to test specific skills, particularly related to code versioning (git), Angular experience, intuitiveness and UIX as well as general forward-thinking and ability to work in isolation with simple briefs. If we find that there are synergies between your stuff and our stuff, we'll be in touch with an offer and take things from there. 

So let's not waste time, here's what we're looking for...

## Test Project

A client has come to us for a proof-of-concept hotel booking system. It needs to be simple and easy to access vital information, the dashboard being the calendar to see booked rooms, available rooms. The ability to book a room and all the error/success messages that may follow (unavailable, full capacity) etc. In short, we want to be able to follow the following process:

- See the full calendar and rooms available on a particular date (read: when I tap on a date, I need to see colour-coded rooms based on availability); this principle applies to the ability to select over a period of dates (a room may be booked on one of the days!)
- Tap on a room for that particular period, and then book the room
- See confirmation of booking, or rejection if there is an error

### Instructions

Below is a step-by-step guide on what we require and how to submit your project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Set up an appropriate NPM project and use the NPM package manager to manage additional assets such as Angular, Bootstrap (or Material, or whatever you choose). Also feel free to use existing libraries for Calendar/Event functionality etc.
3. Using your snappy skills, create the test project and, after committing your code, push the branch back to our Github account.
4. Fill out the form at the end of this page.
6. Zip the repo (**excluding** all folders like node_modules etc. that are installed from the NPM package manager) and email it to kurt@reload.co.za. If the file is larger than 10mb, check your code, something's wrong!
7. Have a cup of coffee and mull over why a raven is like a writing desk.

### Hints
These are some things we're looking for:
- Ability for Angular to interact with a mock API (these can be simple JSON files called via HTTP)
- UIX - simple, effective, informative and easy to navigate
- Keep it simple; we're not looking for booking.com, just a simple calendar interface with the ability to see unavailable rooms, available rooms, book a room etc. (all front-end, no need to commit to a DB or back-end)
- Functionality. Seriously, test that beast before pushing so that when we test it, we're not spending half an hour trying to set it up.
- Be creative with your room choices, how many potential occupants etc. Imagine the call: "Hello, I'd like to book a room for two people from the 25th to the 28th of March." How easy is it for the person on the other end of the phone to check that and respond?)

## Conclusion
Good luck, we look forward to checking out your code!
